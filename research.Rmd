I develop and implement statstistical methodology to solve for scientific problems. My major research interest is related to [Wearable Computing Device](http://www.smart-stats.org/content/wearable-computing-accelerometers-heart-monitors-actigraphs) (accelerometers, heart monitors, actigraphs, etc.). Recently, these devices have gained their popularity in both academia and industry; however, accurately analyzing data generated by them remains a big scientific chanllange. Understanding this type of data, their distribution within person and in the population can help understand the association between these new measurements and human health.

I am interested in extract information (both with parametric and nonparametric approaches)  to summarize noisy and high dimensional activity profiles.

###Selected Research Projects
- __Novel Statistical Framework to Quantify Activity Fragmentation__: Developed a statistical framework to quantify activity fragmentation by analyzing emperical distribution functions of sedentary and acitve time  using non parametric metrics with application to predicting mortality usiang NHANES 2003 - 2006

- __Processed the NHANES 2003 - 2006 Accelerometery Data__: Proposed a data storage and annotation protocol for minute level activity count data. Processed large size and messy NHANES 2003 - 2006 accelerometery data to the proposed wide version which is user friendly. Provided ready to use R functins and tutorial for future researchers who want to use NHANES accelerometery data and to link activity data to other covariates and conclude general statistlca analysis.
