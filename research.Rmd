I develop and implement statistical methodology to solve for scientific problems under the advisement of [Dr. Vadim Zipunnikov](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~vzipunni/). My major research interest is related to high dimensional and high through-put data collected by [Wearable Device](http://www.smart-stats.org/content/wearable-computing-accelerometers-heart-monitors-actigraphs) ([accelerometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer), [actigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actigraphy), heart rate monitor, etc.). Recently, these devices have gained their popularity in both academia and industry; however, accurately analyzing data generated by them remains a big scientific challenge. Understanding this type of data, their distribution within person and in the population can help understand the association between these new measurements and human health. 

My main area of expertise is related to data collection and analysis for objectively measured physical activity, sleep, and circadian rhythmicity using actigraphy, accelerometry etc. I develop novel statistical methodologies and collaborate on multiple scientific projects as well. Specifically, I am interested in the following directions: 1) feature engineering for raw actigraphy data to summarize noisy and high dimensional physiological signal; 2) dimension reduction on high dimensional actigraphy data, and 3) integrative analysis of features acquired from multiple domains/modalities/devices. 

__Scientific Interests__: wearable devices and their applications in public health (e.g. mental health and aging), physical activity assessment, sleep, circadian rhythmicity.

__Statistical Methods__: feature engineering for accelerometry signals, dimension reduction, functional data analysis, integration of multiple modalities.

###Selected Research Projects
- __Integration of data from domains of physical activity, sleep, and circadian rhythmicity__: Implemented JIVE to efficiently deal with multivariate actigraphy features representing multiple domains of physical activity, sleep, and circadian rhythmicity.

- __Processed the NHANES 2003 - 2006 Accelerometery Data__: Processed NHANES 2003 - 2006 accelerometry data to a user-friendly data package. Provided analytical tutorial to conduct statistical analysis on NHANES accelerometry data. 

- __Novel Statistical Framework to Quantify Activity Fragmentation__: Developed a statistical framework to quantify patterns of sedentary/active time accumulation via metrics of fragmentation of bouts and studied their association with mortality in NHANES 2003-2006.

- __Collaborative Research Projects__: multiple collaborative research projects including: monitoring hospitalized patients with various activity trackers, sleep fragmentation and its association with cognitive functions, circadian rhythmicity and its association with mortality etc.
