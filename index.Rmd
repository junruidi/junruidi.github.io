My name is Junrui Di (Simplified Chinese: 邸俊瑞). I'm a $4^{th}$ year PhD Candidate at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/). 

I am a science enthusiastic and fan of data. I enjoy solving scientific problems with the help of statistics.  My philosophy is: data is powerful cause it tells the truth.

In my spare time, I am a music lover and singer.
