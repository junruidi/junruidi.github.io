My name is Junrui Di (Simplified Chinese: 邸俊瑞). I'm a 4th year PhD Candidate at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/). I am part of the Wearable and Implantable Technology (WIT) research group consisting of experts in the field of wearable/implantable technology.  Before joining Hopkins, I recieved my Bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley in 2012, and my Master degree in Biostatistics from Georgetown University in 2013. 

In my spare time, I am a music lover and singer.
